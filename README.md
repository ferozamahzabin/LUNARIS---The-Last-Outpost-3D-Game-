üåë LUNARIS: The Last Outpost

The year is 3025. You are an astronaut stranded on the hostile moon Erevos after a mission goes wrong. Beneath its icy surface, alien species awaken and launch relentless attacks. With oxygen running out, a failing outpost, and scarce resources, survival becomes the ultimate challenge.

The environment itself is unforgiving: meteor storms strike without warning, energy depletes over time, and the lunar terrain offers no mercy. Every moment is a test of endurance as you balance defending your base, collecting resources, and staying alive.

LUNARIS: The Last Outpost is built entirely with OpenGL for a computer graphics project. It combines survival mechanics, basic combat, and environmental hazards into a visually immersive lunar experience. The core challenge: can you outlast the invasion while uncovering the secrets of past missions?
